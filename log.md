# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: September 24, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Mapped out what to learn for the next few weeks to help my job search and solidify some concepts. Starting on a UML modeling course on Lynda.com, I was able to get through the first section fully and some of the second section. 

**Thoughts:**: I remember briefly going over UML in Software Engineering class at TSU but it wasn't this indepth and I don't remember really understanding it then. This course is going into it deeper and I appreciate it. I think I may be spending too much time on it but we will see tomorrow if I can get any futher in the same amount of time. I spent probably 2 hours so far. I am taking copious notes, link to them below.

### Day 1: September 25, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Got through the next two sections in the UML modeling course on Lynda.com. Will hopefully finish the whole course tomorrow.

**Thoughts**: This course isn't holding my attention like that data structures course did. However, I am learning a lot about the different types of diagrams and when to use them. It is really indepth and I did not learn these different types during my Software Engineering class. It would be a lie to say that I can't wait to be done with this course and move on to my next topic.
